# CryptoMining

A collection of theoretical cryptocurrency mining programs implemented in Python and Rust, showcasing various mining methodologies.

## Overview

This repository serves as an educational resource, exploring different techniques and approaches to cryptocurrency mining. The implementations are designed for learning purposes and do not mine real cryptocurrencies.

## Features

- **Multi-Language Implementations**: Compare and contrast mining techniques in both Python and Rust.
- **Diverse Mining Methods**: Explore various theoretical mining strategies and algorithms.
- **Parallel Processing**: Some implementations demonstrate parallel processing to optimize mining operations.

## Getting Started

To explore and run the mining programs, follow the instructions below for your preferred language.

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Rust**: Install the Rust programming language by following the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alexvz2/CryptoMining.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd CryptoMining
   ```

### Running the Python Scripts

1. **Install Dependencies** (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Note: The `requirements.txt` file should list any necessary Python packages. If it's not present, ensure that any required libraries are installed manually.*

2. **Execute the Scripts**:
   - To run `coinminer.py`:
     ```bash
     python coinminer.py
     ```
   - To run `mineCoin.py`:
     ```bash
     python mineCoin.py
     ```
   - To run `mineCoinSync.py`:
     ```bash
     python mineCoinSync.py
     ```

### Running the Rust Programs

1. **Build the Rust Programs**:
   - For `main.rs`:
     ```bash
     rustc main.rs -o main
     ```
   - For `mainParallel.rs`:
     ```bash
     rustc mainParallel.rs -o mainParallel
     ```
   - For `mineCoinSync.rs`:
     ```bash
     rustc mineCoinSync.rs -o mineCoinSync
     ```
   - For `minecoin.rs`:
     ```bash
     rustc minecoin.rs -o minecoin
     ```

2. **Execute the Compiled Binaries**:
   - To run `main`:
     ```bash
     ./main
     ```
   - To run `mainParallel`:
     ```bash
     ./mainParallel
     ```
   - To run `mineCoinSync`:
     ```bash
     ./mineCoinSync
     ```
   - To run `minecoin`:
     ```bash
     ./minecoin
     ```
